# Übersetzer
## ⚠
I made a v2 which is much better. Find it here https://github.com/JM-dQ/Ubersetzer-v2.


## Installation
1. Download and unzip release
2. Create a free DeepL api account here: https://www.deepl.com/pro-api?cta=header-pro-api
3. Find your authentification key here: https://www.deepl.com/account/summary/
4. Copy and paste your authentification key in api/api_key.txt
5. That's it !

## Use
1. Make sure you have something in your clipboard (by copying something)
2. Run the ubersetzer.exe file
3. If you choose to replace text automatically, it will write the translation by itself
5. Get the translation of a word by copying it
6. You can stop the program by copying "STOP"

### Note
It only works on windows.
